WHEN I REQUEST TO ADD A NEW COMPONENT / FEATURE, ALWAYS BEGIN BY LOOKING AT THE PAGE THEN ANALYSING. If the page already has too many lines of code and you've decided to create a new component always try and create a component in the components folder. Then once the component has been created simply import it.
