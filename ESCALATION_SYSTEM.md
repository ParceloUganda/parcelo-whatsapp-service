# 🚨 WhatsApp Escalation System

## 📋 Overview

This system allows the WhatsApp bot to intelligently escalate conversations to human support agents when needed, with full context, sentiment analysis, and priority routing.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### **1. Updated Escalation Agent (`agent_runner.py`)**

#### **Enhanced EscalationOutput Model:**
```python
class EscalationOutput(BaseModel):
    escalate: bool
    tool: Optional[str]
    reason: str  # Full explanation
    category: str  # payment_issue, delivery_problem, etc.
    sentiment: str  # angry, negative, neutral, positive, confused
    priority: str  # urgent, high, medium, low
    journey_stage: Optional[str]  # quotation, cart, payment, delivery
    response_text: str
```

#### **New Escalation Tool:**
```python
@_tool("EscalateToHuman", "Escalate conversation to human agent")
def escalate_to_human_tool(
    customer_id: str,
    reason: str,
    category: str,
    sentiment: str,
    priority: str,
    journey_stage: Optional[str] = None
)
```

#### **Enhanced Agent Instructions:**
The escalation agent now:
- ✅ Detects customer sentiment (angry, negative, neutral, positive, confused)
- ✅ Categorizes escalation type (payment, delivery, refund, complaint, etc.)
- ✅ Sets appropriate priority (urgent, high, medium, low)
- ✅ Identifies customer journey stage
- ✅ Provides clear reason for escalation

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### **Existing `support_tickets` Table (Enhanced)**

**New WhatsApp-Specific Columns:**

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `source_type` | TEXT | Channel: whatsapp, web, email, chat, phone |
| `source_reference_id` | UUID | chat_session_id for WhatsApp |
| `source_phone_number` | TEXT | Customer's phone (256700123456) |
| `escalation_reason` | TEXT | Why escalation was needed |
| `escalation_category` | TEXT | payment_issue, delivery_problem, etc. |
| `bot_detected_sentiment` | TEXT | angry, negative, neutral, positive, confused |
| `customer_journey_stage` | TEXT | quotation, cart, payment, delivery |
| `first_response_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | When human agent first responded |
| `resolution_notes` | TEXT | How issue was resolved |
| `resolution_category` | TEXT | Type of resolution |
| `metadata` | JSONB | Conversation context, bot confidence, keywords |

**Existing Columns (Already There):**
- `customer_id`, `assigned_to_agent_id`
- `status` (open, in_progress, awaiting_customer, resolved, closed)
- `priority` (low, medium, high, urgent)
- `subject`, timestamps

## 🎯 When Bot Escalates

### **Automatic Escalation Triggers:**

1. **Customer Sentiment:**
   - 😡 Angry language, harsh words
   - 😞 Repeated frustration
   - 🤔 Confusion after multiple explanations

2. **Issue Type:**
   - 💸 Payment disputes
   - 📦 Lost or damaged packages
   - 🔙 Refund requests
   - ⚠️ Complaints about service

3. **Explicit Request:**
   - "I want to speak to a human"
   - "Transfer me to an agent"
   - "Let me talk to your manager"

4. **Bot Limitation:**
   - Bot attempted resolution 2-3 times
   - Issue requires manual intervention
   - Complex problem beyond bot's capabilities

### **Tool Execution Handler:**

        summary = _create_conversation_summary(last_messages)
        
        # Extract keywords that triggered escalation
        keywords = _extract_keywords(conversation_history)

## 🎨 Example Conversations

### **Scenario 1: Angry Customer (Urgent Priority)**

```
Customer: "This is ridiculous! I paid 2 weeks ago and still no delivery! Give me my money back NOW!"

Bot → Classifier → Routes to ESCALATION

Escalation Agent:
  - Sentiment: ANGRY
  - Category: delivery_problem
  - Priority: URGENT
  - Reason: "Customer paid 2 weeks ago, no delivery, demanding refund"
  - Journey Stage: delivery

Bot → Creates support ticket

Bot: "🙋 I understand you're frustrated, and I apologize for the inconvenience.

I've immediately connected you with our support team.

📋 Ticket: TKT-2025-001
⏱️ A human agent will respond within 15 minutes.

Thank you for your patience."

[Human Agent (5 minutes later)]:
"Hi, I'm Sarah from Parcelo support. I see your order ORD-123 is delayed. 
I sincerely apologize. Let me check with our shipping partner immediately..."
```

---

### **Scenario 2: Confused Customer (Medium Priority)**

```
Customer: "I'm so confused. I added items to cart but don't know how to pay. Can someone help me?"

Bot → Routes to ESCALATION

Escalation Agent:
  - Sentiment: CONFUSED
  - Category: technical_issue
  - Priority: MEDIUM
  - Reason: "Customer doesn't understand payment process"
  - Journey Stage: cart

Bot: "🙋 I've connected you with our support team for assistance.

📋 Your ticket number: TKT-2025-002
⏱️ An agent will respond shortly.

Is there anything else I can help you with while you wait?"

[Agent walks customer through checkout process]
```

---

### **Scenario 3: Polite Refund Request (High Priority)**

```
Customer: "Hello, I received my order but the item is damaged. I'd like to request a refund please."

Bot → Routes to ESCALATION

Escalation Agent:
  - Sentiment: POSITIVE
  - Category: refund_request
  - Priority: HIGH
  - Reason: "Customer received damaged item, requesting refund"
  - Journey Stage: delivery

Bot: "🙋 I'm sorry to hear about the damaged item. I've connected you with our support team.

📋 Ticket: TKT-2025-003

An agent will help you with the refund process shortly.
Please have photos of the damaged item ready if possible."
```

## 📈 Analytics & Reporting

### **Key Metrics to Track:**

1. **Escalation Rate:** % of conversations escalated
2. **Resolution Time:** Time from escalation to resolution
3. **Sentiment Distribution:** angry vs neutral vs positive
4. **Category Breakdown:** Most common issues
5. **Priority Distribution:** urgent vs high vs medium
6. **First Response Time:** How fast agents respond
7. **Customer Satisfaction:** Post-resolution feedback

### **SQL Queries:**

```sql
-- Escalation rate by category
SELECT 
  escalation_category,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as percentage
FROM support_tickets
WHERE source_type = 'whatsapp'
  AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY escalation_category
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Average response time by priority
SELECT 
  priority,
  COUNT(*) as tickets,
  ROUND(AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (first_response_at - created_at))/60), 1) as avg_minutes
FROM support_tickets
WHERE first_response_at IS NOT NULL
  AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY priority
ORDER BY avg_minutes;

-- Sentiment analysis
SELECT 
  bot_detected_sentiment,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN status = 'resolved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100, 1) as resolution_rate
FROM support_tickets
WHERE source_type = 'whatsapp'
  AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY bot_detected_sentiment;
```
